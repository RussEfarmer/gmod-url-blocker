# gmod-url-blocker
This addon blocks URLs sent in game chat of Garry's Mod servers. This addon is server side.

This addon is based on my bad-word-slur-blocker addon, but modified with pattern matching to block any URL or IP address sent in game chat. Both addons can be used at the same time.

This addon was created with the intention of halting illegal activity on servers. If your server is struggling with illegal activity of its players, please work with your local law enforcement agencies to ensure appropriate legal action is taken.
